## Gulp Starter Template

This repo contains a gulpfile and a few other files that are used to build a starter template for a new static (HTML/CSS/JS) project.

### How to use this template

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp`
4. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

The CSS will not load directly, just open scss/index.scss and Save it. The CSS folder would be generated automatically.

ðŸ”¥ At this point you should have a working project running on localhost:3000
